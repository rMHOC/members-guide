Hello everybody and welcome to MHoC! We really
hope you enjoy your time here, and should you have any
questions we are always available to answer. MHoC is a
fascinating community where we all share a love for
debate and politics, you can get involved in so many
ways: debating, legislating, amending, writing for the
press, surveying, working on committees, writing reports,
looking into devolved matters and so much more (most
importantly we're all here to have a bit of fun). Our
community is unique, we have members from across the
world, of all ages, backgrounds and knowledge and
we're glad you've decided to explore. This new members
guide will cover the ins and outs of MHoC and will
hopefully provide you with an understanding of we work
and operate. We sincerely hope you enjoy your time
here!
