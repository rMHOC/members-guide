# Coalitions
Due to the nature of MHOC, we have never had a single party
with a majority in Parliament, which means that coalitions are
necessary for forming governments. Representatives of parties
will meet after the election, and attempt to negotiate an
agreement. This involves a degree of compromise between the
parties, so it's best to try and remain on good terms with likely
partners.

All members of the coalition are expected to vote in favour of
government legislation, and for this reason are ‘whipped.’ MP’s
who defy serious whips, such as on landmark legislation, or on
the budget are often fired from any positions in the Cabinet and
may even be expelled from their party.

Coalitions also take the solidarity seriously. It is often
considered bad etiquette to express concerns about the
coalition in public subreddits. Members of the coalition are
instead encouraged to voice criticism in private.
