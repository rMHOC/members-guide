# Elections
MHoC holds elections every six months. An election is called by the
speakership, who liaise with the government and the parties to decide
on the best timing. Each party is responsible for nominating candidates
to stand in various constituencies, and in the proportional ‘list seats.’
Our elections are an awfully confusing time for new members. This is
mostly due to the process we use. While in the past we relied on
members of reddit actually voting for their preferred party, we now
‘simulate elections’ meaning that parties compete for virtual voters. The
success of a part is affected by their ‘modifiers’ - a series of multipliers
and values that impact the amount of people that will vote for them.
Modifiers reward activity throughout the term, with modifiers for things
such as legislative output, MP turnout and campaigning. Modifiers
effectively reflect how the public see the party: a stable and active
party will do well, while a party that is gripped by internal strife and
inactivity will do poorly in elections.

The number of seats in the House of Commons often fluctuates. In our
first election, we only had 30 seats. However in our second election,
only six months later, we had 75. At the third election it was 100 seats,
and in the fourth it was 115 seats.

At the moment we have 100 seats in the Commons, plus overhang.

By convention, seats won in an election belong to the party that won
them, as opposed to the member. This stops us having constant by-
elections as members come and go from the simulation. However, there
are exceptions to this rule, if an independent member wins their seat
then they ‘own’ it, meaning that if they resign the seat goes to a by-
election. They can also defect to a political party and
strengthen that party in the Commons.
