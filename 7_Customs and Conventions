# Customs and Conventions

## Forms of address
By convention Members of Parliament who sit in the House of
Commons are never referred to directly, and must be addressed via
the Speaker. Members who sit in the House of Lords by convention
address the entire chamber.

### MPs without titles:
The Honourable Member/Lady/Gentleman/Pronoun for
[constituency]
### MPs in the Privy Council:
The Right Honourable Member/Lady/Gentleman/Pronoun for
[constituency]
### Peers:
Members of the Lords address their speech to the entirety of the
chamber. Expressions such as ‘My Lords’,’Your Lordships’ and ‘The
Noble Lord’ are common.

## Examples:
“Mr Speaker, has The Honourable Member considered that the
plans to build the Longdendale Bypass are unnecessary? “
“Mr Speaker, what has the Right Honourable Lady done to ease
the congestion in the Longdendale Valley?”
“My Lords, I wish to ask if the Government has any plans
to alleviate traffic congestion along the A57?”

## Question Sessions
We have three question sessions a week, where all members of the
simulation are encouraged to come and hold the Government to
account by asking them questions. This is the primary method of
getting answers from the government, and is a central part of the
game. Question sessions are held on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday.
In question sessions, the Shadow Secretary who holds responsibility
for the topic being discussed is allowed to ask unlimited questions to
their Government counterpart. Spokespeople from parties in the
Unofficial Opposition are allowed to ask 6 questions. Everyone else
may ask 2 questions; and are allowed to ask another question in
response to each answer they receive.
Forms of address in question sessions are much the same as in other
debates, however it is considered courteous to refer to the person
answering the questions as ‘The Secretary’ or ‘The Secretary of State
for [insert cabinet position].’ Similar courtesies should be extended to
the Shadow Secretary of State when answering one of their
questions.

## Swearing in
Before an MP is allowed to comment in debate, they must swear in.
There are variations of the oath that can be taken. One such
variation is the traditional oath of loyalty to the crown, while other
variations include atheist and republican versions. Additionally,
members can choose to swear in using additional languages
including Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Cornish. A thread for swearing
in is posted at the start of a parliamentary term, and regardless of
when an MP is appointed or elected, they must swear in.

## Whipping
Part of being an MP is voting on legislation, and part of voting on
legislation is being whipped. Each party will send round messages
regarding how MP’s should vote on upcoming legislation. Obeying
the whip is often considered a mark of a good parliamentarian,
although some MP’s may break a whip if they feel strongly enough
about the legislation in question.
While the punishments for breaking the whip and often vary between
parties, the following is a general outline of how a whip works:
Free Vote: Sometimes referred to as a ‘conscience’ vote, this signifies
that the party do not have any set stance on the legislation, and will
accordingly let their MP’s vote as they wish. [Continued on next
page]

- 1 Line: Considered to be an advisory whip, this signifies the way a
party would ‘like’ their MP’s to vote. Punishments for breaking a 1
line whip are often light or non-existent.

- 2 Line: Considered to be a request to vote one way, voting the
opposite way to a 2 line whip is considered to be a breach of
discipline. This whip is normally used on relatively important
legislation, and as such, punishments may be serious, but not as
serious as defying a 3 line.

- 3 Line: Considered to be an order to vote on way. Defying a 3 line
whip can often lead to expulsion from the Cabinet/Shadow
Cabinet, deselection as an MP, or possible expulsion from the
party. As a result of the harsh punishments, 3 line whips are only
normally used on large pieces of legislation, such as the annual
budget.
