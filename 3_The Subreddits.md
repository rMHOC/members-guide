# The Subreddits
## /r/MHoC
The House of Commons is the lower chamber of Parliament.
This is often the busiest subreddit, and where most of the action
takes place. Anyone can participate in submitting and debating
bills and motions, as well as holding the government to account
at Ministers and Prime Ministers Question time.

Anyone can comment on this subreddit, be they MP, Peer or just
a regular member.

## /r/MHoL
The House of Lords is the upper chamber of Parliament. This is
where legislation is amended and tweaked, so that it is more
effective. This is a more exclusive subreddit, while anyone can
read the business of the House, only designated lords can
comment.

Lords are appointed by the Speaker of the House of Lords, and
are split into Working Peers -
Members of the simulation who have specialist knowledge in
one or more subject areas and *Achievement Peers* who are
granted a peership in return for valuable contributions to the
community.

## /r/MHoCPress
The home of the various press outlets and independent writers.
If something has happened in the MHoC world, then you can
bet that someone has published an article about it.

From here you can browse through the subreddits of the various
press organisations and read their latest works. Some of the
most notable press organisations include: The Monolith, The
MBBC and The Endeavour amongst others. The Government
and Official Opposition press offices can also be found through
this subreddit, as can the press offices of individual parties.

## /r/MHoCMeta
This is where you can find discussion about the how the game is
run. Anyone is free to comment or post on the subreddit with
suggestions and critique.

## /r/MHoCStrangersBar
Much like the real life Strangers Bar, this is where MPâ€™s and
other community members congregate to put their feet up and
have a virtual drink. This is the home of off topic discussion,
and is often used after elections to discuss, gloat and otherwise
have a laugh. The Strangers Bar is often utilised to share
surveys and questionnaires.

## /r/MHolyrood
This is the home of the devolved Scottish administration, and is
home to affairs that are devolved to Scotland.

## /r/MStormont
This is the home of the devolved Northern Irish administration,
and is home to affairs that are devolved to Northern Ireland.

In addition, each party on MHoC will have their own private
subreddit for their respective members. Party subreddits are
used for all sorts of activity, including legislation creation,
internal elections, campaign operations and much, much more.

MHoC also has a wiki, which can be found at: http://
