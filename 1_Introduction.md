# Chapter 1: Introduction

The Model Houses of Parliament is a Reddit based
simulation of British politics - with a twist.

We are based over numerous subreddits, but most of
the action takes place in the two chambers of Parliament;
the Model House of Commons (MHoC) and the Model
House of Lords (MHoL).

The simulation is moderated by three moderators,
commonly known as ‘the triumvirate.’ Our Head
Moderator is /u/joker8765, the Speaker of the House of
Commons is /u/DF44, and the Speaker of the
House of Lords is currently being elected. These three 
individuals - alongside their teams of Deputy Speakers-
run and look after the simulation.

I sincerely hope that this guide will prove to be
informative, and help you understand how our
community works.
